## ❤️ Gamified Contributors Experience for Gnomes! ❤️

###  Introduction :

"_At first, there was Bitcoin, out of entropy soup of the greater All. Then, there was Ethereum, which was created in the likeness of Bitcoin, but made Turing complete.
Among these were Tendermint and Cosmos to engineer robust PoS and IBC. Then came Gno upon Cosmos and there spring forth Gnoland, simulated by the Gnomes of the Greater Resistance."_
Gno is an interpreted and fully-deterministic implementation of the Go programming language, designed to build succinct and composable smart contracts. The first blockchain to use it is gno.land, a Proof of Contribution-based chain, backed by a variation of the Tendermint consensus engine.

In the future, contributors will be paid automatically for their contributions on the blockchain project, using different data prodivers prooving valuable contributions, and a decentralized reviewing organization.

### Gnolove Experimentation 
Our goal with this project is to experiment a creative "overview dashboard" to see the [Gnoland](https://github.com/gnolang) project development efforts, contributors activities, and access to the data with a efficient way. 
It could be useful later for the organization (community, managers, etc.) to access the information, but main goals right now are : 
- boost developers motivation to join the movement! 🏆
- create a fun community experience! 🥇
- offer an alternative option to visualize activity! 📊
- experiment! 🧰

#### Ideas for future:
- Offer goodies to top contributors every month, claiming their rewards: www.samourai.fun
- Generate automatically some dev reports to enforce information transparency for non-tech communities
- Connect it to a newsletter to receive a monthly gno dev report
- ... 🧠 'enter your ideas'

#### Current Love Power Equation: 

| Contribution Type | Points |
| -------- | -------- | 
| PR Merged     | 10     | 
| PR Created     | 2     | 
| Review done    | 2  | 
| Issue openned    | 0,5    | 
| Comment on PR    | 0,01    | 

#### Later we would like to add: 
- Emojis Points: Points when some positive Emojis are posted by others (🔥❤️🚀...)
- N Codelines: How to optimize points for a 'long PR' ?

To be continued,
