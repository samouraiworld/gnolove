## ‚ù§Ô∏è Gamified Contributors Experience for Gnomes! ‚ù§Ô∏è

###  Introduction :

"_At first, there was Bitcoin, out of entropy soup of the greater All. Then, there was Ethereum, which was created in the likeness of Bitcoin, but made Turing complete.
Among these were Tendermint and Cosmos to engineer robust PoS and IBC. Then came Gno upon Cosmos and there spring forth Gnoland, simulated by the Gnomes of the Greater Resistance._"
Gno is an interpreted and fully-deterministic implementation of the Go programming language, designed to build succinct and composable smart contracts. The first blockchain to use it is gno.land, a Proof of Contribution-based chain, backed by a variation of the Tendermint consensus engine.

In the future, contributors will be paid automatically for their contributions on the blockchain project, using different data prodivers prooving valuable contributions, and a decentralized reviewing organization.

### Gnolove
Gnolove is a scoreboard for the Gno chain that showcases contributors, open‚Äësource repositories, activity and development efforts across the Gnoland ecosystem. Our aim is to make all this data in easily accessible.

Main goals right now are : 
- boost developers motivation to join the movement! üèÜ
- create a fun community experience! ü•á
- offer an alternative option to visualize activity! üìä
- experiment! üß∞

### Features
- Overview of Gnoland development efforts
- Leaderboard of top contributors, through calculating love power.
- Weekly pull request report for each team and each repository
- Ability to view and vote on proposals as GovDAO member
- Ability to view and manage Gno validators
- Visual contributor activity (commits, issues, pull requests, reviews) tracking and timeline
- Gno-related tutorial videos
- Ability to set up webhooks to periodically receive leaderboards in Discord or Slack

#### Ideas for future
- Offer goodies to top contributors every month, claiming their rewards: www.samourai.fun
- Generate automatically some dev reports to enforce information transparency for non-tech communities
- Connect it to a newsletter to receive a monthly gno dev report
- ... üß† 'enter your ideas'
