# End to End testing

Tested script to setup a local environment to test govdao setup on Gnolove.
This is generated, so it can easily be upgraded (useless logs, ...)

Overall you've to:
- Create the key a, b, c, d
- Change the address from `setup_environment.sh` and `create_fake_data.sh`
- Do `./test_govdao.sh`

From there it should work fine and launch the internet page with GovDAO :)
